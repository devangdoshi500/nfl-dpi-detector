# DPI Labeling Rubric v1

### Pass Interference (NFL Rulebook)

**Pass Interference** is defined as:

> Any act by a player more than **one yard beyond the line of scrimmage**
> that **significantly hinders** an eligible player's opportunity
> to catch the ball.

### Criteria for Clip Inclusion and Labeling


Label key:
- 1 = Defensive Pass Interference
- 0 = No DPI

Clips are to be included only if:
- The receiver and defender(s) involved in the contested catch are visible at contact
- The ball arrival window is visible or strongly inferable
- The clip captures ~1–2s before contact through the catch attempt

Label as 1 if (any):
- Early contact that restricts the receiver before the ball arrives
- Arm grab/hook/hold that materially restricts during the catch attempt
- Clear shove/extension that displaces the receiver during the play on the ball

Label as 0 if (any):
- Incidental contact without restriction
- Both players play the ball with minimal contact
- Contact occurs after ball arrives and does not restrict the catch attempt

Clips showcasing edge cases will not be included in initial versions
